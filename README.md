# SpeedrunEthereum-Contracts

This repository contains my completed Solidity smart contracts for the SpeedRunEthereum challenge series. Each folder is a standalone challenge exploring different core Ethereum development concepts such as tokens, staking, decentralized exchanges, randomness exploitation, DeFi primitives, prediction markets, and zero-knowledge voting.

Challenges are implemented using Scaffold-ETH tooling and tested locally. Many of these contracts were deployed and interacted with through a local testnet environment.

See individual folders for details.
